<h1 id="killphisher-zero-day-phishing-protection">Killphisher: Zero-Day Phishing Protection</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We propose a new anti-phishing technique based on creating large visual
differences between legitimate sites and phishing pages which attempt to mimic
them.</p>
<p>Attackers can automatically create thousands of customized phishing emails,
domains and pages which, being newly minted, evade the browser&#39;s
blacklist-based phishing protection. High-value individuals and employees of
sensitive organizations are especially vulnerable to such <em>zero-day phishing</em>
attacks.</p>
<p>We increase the contrast in user experience between browsing a genuine page
versus an imitation page in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotate genuine login pages with a personal image selected by the user.</li>
<li>Take periodic screenshots of the active browser tab and raise an alarm if
it visually resembles the login page of a whitelisted site. The comparison
is done using computer vision techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach can thus effectively protect against zero-day phishing, which
would not be caught by a blacklist-based system. It is implemented as a browser
plugin. </p>
<h2 id="how-we-get-phished">How We Get Phished</h2>
<p>Phishing is an attack on the vulnerabilities of the human cognitive system,
rather than an attack on the vulnerabilities of software. Consider the task of
navigating a computer interface to access protected resources like email,
social networking and bank accounts through the lens of Daniel Kahneman&#39;s model
of human thought processes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems">System 1 and System 2</a>.</p>
<p>System 1 is subconscious, effortless, intuitive, emotional. It is responsible
for activies like recognizing faces, expressions, and walking around a room
without bumping into things. System 2 is effortful, slow, consciously allocates
attention to process complex situations, like writing an email or multiplying
large numbers.</p>
<p>When System 1 gets confused or surprised, it escalates the matter to System 2,
which then allocates attention to the event and formulates a response.</p>
<p>A cardinal rule of UX design is that the user&#39;s System 1 should effortlessly
parse the user interface landscape and navigate common workflows, and involve
System 2 if and only if necessary. Frequent interruptions hitting System 2 are
a sign of poor design. It leads to the expenditure of scarce attention on
low-level details, for example on figuring out the formatting toolbar, rather
than concentrating on the higher level task of what to write. But if System 2
is not involved when needed, the user&#39;s System 1 may <em>OK</em> and <em>I Agree</em> its way
into triggering irrevocable actions like deleting files without the user really
intending to do so.</p>
<p>In addition to large warnings and red buttons, some UIs deliberately place
speedbumps before destructive activities which cannot be automatically driven
through by System 1, but require proof of System 2&#39;s acquiescence. For example,
Github asks the user to type the name of the project before permanent deletion.</p>
<p>For most people, login dialogs are largely handled by System 1. If the page
passes System 1&#39;s visual sniff test, recognizing a familiar logo and page
layout, it will enter the username and password almost automatically, while
System 2 is already thinking ahead about the email to be written, or the bank
transaction to be carried out.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is made worse by factors like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login sessions time out randomly. So clicking on a link and being
presented with a login dialog is not unexpected, and doesn&#39;t trigger
any red flags by itself. Mails purporting to be from a boss, friend
or a corporate/government authority further disarm suspicion.</li>
<li>People use computers and smartphones in an increasingly wide variety of
situations when they are not necessarily at their cognitive best. They
may be sleepy, tired, on the move, under the influence, without their
glasses, and still be checking messages and clicking on links.</li>
<li>System 1 &quot;autocorrects&quot; typos and other small deviations from the norm,
making them invisible to System 2. Typosquatting domains, IDN homograph
attacks and the easy availability of SSL certificates means that even an
alert user examining the page with System 2 in full play may be fooled.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most browsers include effective blacklist-based anti-phishing measures.
However, it is easy for attackers to automatically create thousands of
personalized zero-day phishing emails, domains and pages which have never been
seen before, and are thus not on any blacklist. Employees and contractors of
governments, banks, public utilities and other sensitive organizations are
especially at risk from such targeted zero-day &quot;spearphishing&quot; attacks.</p>
<h2 id="perceptual-anti-phishing">Perceptual anti-phishing</h2>
<p>Our approach is inspired by the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08568">The Future of Ad Blocking</a> by
Storey et al, which introduces a novel <em>perceptual ad blocking</em> technique. It
ignores HTML markup and blacklists and uses lightweight computer vision
techniques to &quot;see&quot; the page like a human and recognize features of the ad
(like the AdChoices icon) which must be present for regulatory purposes.</p>
<p>We observe that the same constraint holds for phishing - HTML markup may be
obfuscated, blacklists may be thwarted, but at the end of the day, the rendered
phishing page must look, in human eyes, very similar to the page it imitates.
Thus, it can be identified by computer vision techniques.</p>
<p>We propose a whitelist-based anti-phishing technique, which creates a large
perceptual difference between a genuine login page and a phishing page, such
that even the System 1 of users who are browsing while cognitively impaired
can instantly tell that something is wrong when they navigate to a phishing
page.</p>
<p>Normally, the perceptual difference between the real page and the phishing page
is very small.</p>
<p><img src="img/paypal-real-orig.png" alt="Paypal Real">
<img src="img/paypal-fake-orig.png" alt="Paypal Fake"></p>
<p>We increase this difference in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Green flag:</strong> annotating the genuine page by displaying a personal image
within a &quot;stamp of approval&quot; popup for a few seconds before automatically
relinquishing control to the page. This image is known only to the user
and not to the web service.</li>
<li><strong>Red flag:</strong> flagging a phishing page with a popup which stays until
dismissed by an explicit System 2 action, such as typing a confirmation.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="img/paypal-greenflag.gif" alt="Paypal Greenflag">
<em>Actual Paypal login, green flag</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="img/paypal-redflag.gif" alt="Paypal Redflag">
<em>Paypal Phish, red flag</em></p>
<p>These methods are independent of each other. However, using them together is
much more effective than either one alone, as it maximizes the perceptual
difference between the two cases, and makes up for limitations and false
negatives.</p>
<p>Both approaches need a whitelist. The plugin ships with a default list of
the most popular phishing targets - Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Paypal,
etc. There are a long tail of banking and other corporate sites which can be
added by the user.</p>
<p>While there are hundreds of thousands of sites which may be potential
phishing targets, any given user probably uses less than a hundred, of which
perhaps a dozen or two would contain personal or financial information
which need serious protection.</p>
<p>Each whitelist entry contains the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Valid login URL(s) for a given service.</li>
<li>Image snippets from a screenshot of the login page which a human System 1
would use to identify the service. This would typically include the logo
and the login/password button.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="green-flag">Green Flag</h3>
<p>During the plugin configuration, the user supplies a private image known only
to himself or herself, to be displayed whenever they navigate to a legitimate
whitelisted login URL. This image is displayed in a modal popup sized and
positioned at the center of the viewport for a few seconds before automatically
retreating to the top right of the screen.</p>
<p>The image should be of a nature that its <em>absence</em> would be noticed by System 1.
To this end, we suggest the following guidelines to select a guard image which
should be visually as well as emotionally salient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something which evokes a strong positive emotional response: a child,
a pet, a favourite food, a favorite cartoon clip.</li>
<li>Sharp images with bright colours, high contrast.</li>
<li>Animated images work better than static images.</li>
<li>A video clip would be even better. However, we need to balance the
additional memorability and emotional impact of sound (&#39;cha-ching!&#39;)
against the possibility of alerting potential shoulder-surfers within
earshot that a sensitive site was being accessed.</li>
<li>Avoid images which have already been published on social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiteKey">SiteKey</a>, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2007/06/sec/">reported</a> to
be fairly ineffective, as people happily enter credentials even on sites which
don&#39;t display their personal image.</p>
<p>We suggest that the failure of SiteKey-like schemes is because they did not
create a strong enough impression on System 1 that their absence was noted.
Pictures were typically small and of little personal significance.</p>
<p>Moreover, SiteKey is implemented on the server side, and personal images are
vulnerable to being recovered by spearphishers. A proliferation of different
images on different sites leads to desensitization.</p>
<p>We suggest that associating a single emotionally salient and rewarding image
at the client side, across all protected login pages, will result in
System 1 being conditioned (not unlike Pavlov&#39;s dog) to expect the image and
feel &quot;cheated&quot; by its absence, escalating the matter to System 2.</p>
<p>The green flag has negligible performance impact, as no image processing or
DOM processing is involved - we just check the URL to see if it belongs in the
whitelist and do our song-and-dance routine.</p>
<h3 id="red-flag">Red Flag</h3>
<p>To implement red-flagging of suspect pages, we need to identify whether the
page loaded on the currently active browser tab is perceptually similar to the
login pages of protected sites.</p>
<p>This can be done in several ways. The simplest would be to follow the lead of
the perceptual ad blocking plugin and check all image-like elements (<em>divs</em>
with backgrounds, <em>img</em> elements and <em>svg</em> elements) against a list of
logo/image snippets of each protected site using perceptual hashes. While this
approach would work in a majority of cases, as phishers tend to be copy
original pages as far as possible, it has two drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>It results in false positives, as logos of Google and popular
sites are present on many non-phishing sites - tech news, for example.</li>
<li>It is easy to defeat. Scaling, padding images, rotating images using CSS,
splitting images such that they appear as different <em>img</em> elements in the
source (thus not matching anything) but placed such that they visually
appear like the original, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>We feel that the only robust method is to take the principle of perceptual
matching to its logical conclusion: take a screenshot of the active tab every
few seconds, which gives us an image of the rendered page as seen by the user.
We search the screenshot for the presence of image snippets from the login page
of every protected site.</p>
<p>We have tried different algorithms to empirically figure out the
performance vs accuracy tradeoff.</p>
<p>(ADD: chart of different algorithms)</p>
<p>Currently we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_FAST_and_rotated_BRIEF">ORB</a> as implemented in <a href="https://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/">JSFeat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Explore deep learning approaches as an alternative to computer vision
algorithms. <a href="https://www.phishtank.com/">PhishTank</a> samples show that a
significant percentage of phishing pages mimic the color scheme, look and feel,
but use entirely different page layouts, different icons from the original.
Deep learning based image classification might do better to recognize these
than straight-up feature matching against the real site. Most existing deep
learning models use real world images as training data. So just retraining
Inception, for instance, with webpage screenshots does not work very well.  A
different model may be called for.  The CPU requirements are also likely to
price machine learning off the browser and into a central service.</p>
<p>Red-flagging is resource intensive and can potentially cause enough of a UX,
performance hit and/or battery usage to be practically infeasible. In
mitigation,</p>
<ul>
<li>The set of protected sites is expected to be small for a given user, so
we expect that the number of images to be matched to be correspondingly
limited.</li>
<li>Checking happens in the background page, so it does not interfere with
the responsiveness of the content page.</li>
<li>Check pages only if a set of (optional) conditions are met:<ul>
<li>The page contains a visible input field of the password type.</li>
<li>The user has just entered a word from a pre-specified list of usernames
they own</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In high-security/low-privacy environments, the plugin can forward
screenshots to a central server to run red flag processing. The
chilling effect on non-work browsing may be tolerated well by
corporates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cost-of-different-approaches">Cost of different approaches</h2>
<p>cognitive cost, programming cost, maintenance cost</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Both green and red flag methods have limitations and attacks which can reduce
their effectiveness. This is why it is important to use both.</p>
<ul>
<li>A certificate from a compromised CA, a corporate SSL proxy, or a key
stolen from the original site can be used to setup an MITM attack which
will be green flagged. To address this, a more rigorous green flag could
store IP addresses, certificate details of previous visits to the site
and warn if they changed.</li>
<li>Distorting the page to defeat image matching, but which will be acceptable
to System 1. For instance, change the space between login/password fields,
adding noise, skewing the elements. To counter this, we can pick identifying
fragments such that changes which break recognition by the algorithm will
also break recognition by humans. Use multiple fragments, all of which will
need to be matched before the page is flagged as a match.</li>
</ul>
