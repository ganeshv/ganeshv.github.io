    <p>
A blockchain is a public, append-only transaction log. Anonymous, untrusted participants can add valid blocks of transactions to the end of the blockchain, without involving a central co-ordinator or trusted authority. While BitTorrent lets us share fixed content like ISOs via a swarm of untrusted peers, a blockchain let us share content and add to it, making it a sort of <em>appendable torrent</em>. The flagship blockchain application is the Bitcoin currency, but it can be used as a building block to solve many other large-scale distributed problems like identity, smart contracts, asset registries and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    In computer science terms, blockchains are a practical solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">distributed consensus problem</a>. This, like the <a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive">Infinite Improbability Drive</a> was considered <em>almost</em> impossible. Then one day, young Satoshi brewed a cup of really hot tea&hellip;
    </p>

    <p>
Let us sidle up to blockchains by considering how a typical open-source project works. It has a git repository, a mailing list, a Benevolent Dictator-For-Life and a community. Standard operating procedure:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Contributors send out patches to the mailing list.</li>
    <li>The BDFL collects outstanding patches, verifies them, batches all valid patches into a commit, pushes to git repo.</li>
    <li>Everybody pulls the new commit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
With git, every participant has their own copy of the repo with the entire commit history. Each commit is identified by <i>hash(commit contents + parent commit-id)</i>. This makes commit history immutable and tamper-proof. The very name of the latest commit depends on its entire ancestry. Everybody knows the rules for what is considered valid code (it must compile, pass the regression tests, etc.), so each community member can independently verify the validity of patches and the commit history.
    </p>

    <div class="gcontainer" id="blockchain">
    </div>
    <p><em>Tamper-proof chain: change the contents of any block &mdash; names of that block and all subsequent blocks change.</em></p>
    <p>
So there are limits to the BDFL's power: they cannot change history or commit spurious patches without everyone noticing. They can, however, simply ignore someone's patches out of spite.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now let's look at the blockchain.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>The blockchain is very much like a git repo with a single branch. Transactions are batched into blocks, just as patches were batched into commits. Like commits, blocks are identified by block-ids derived from <i>hash(block contents + parent block-id)</i>.</li>
    <li>There is a P2P network ("mailing list") where participants announce new transactions for incorporation into a block.</li>
    <li>There is no BDFL. Instead, there are many maintainers (called <em>miners</em> in Bitcoin). Anyone can be a maintainer. Each one has a copy of the whole blockchain repo and can verify the validity of every block and transaction. Each also has a list of valid proposed transactions gathered by listening to the chatter on the P2P network.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
Which of the maintainers in this anarchist paradise gets to issue the next commit, and how does everyone agree? All maintainers will have perfectly valid candidate blocks. This is the great distributed consensus problem. Made much worse by the fact that participants don't have an identity, join and leave when they like, there is no global time, messages can get reordered, etc. etc.
    </p>
    <p>
Well, suppose God rolls dice and anoints a lucky maintainer as BDFL-du-jour, and the chosen one commits the next block to universal acclaim. Everybody updates their blockchain with the latest commit, and after a few minutes, God rolls again. (In the future, everyone will be dictator for 15 minutes.)
    </p>

    <p>
But we don't like the idea of God playing dice. Instead, we run a decentralized lottery by asking each miner to flip, say, 30 coins. The one who gets all heads wins, and is anointed BDFL-du-jour. To avoid the tedium of passing around videos and allegations of cheating, we use the equivalent process of selecting the miner whose proposed block-id is a &ldquo;lucky number&rdquo; with 30 leading zeros. Miners keep tweaking the contents of their candidate block and compute <i>hash(block contents, parent block-id)</i> until they get a lucky number. There is a special <em>nonce</em> field in the block which can be tweaked for this purpose without affecting the transaction payload. Whoever finds a winner promptly publishes their block. Everyone can (easily) verify the fact that this is a winning block by computing its hash, and append it to their copy of the blockchain.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the output of the hash algorithm is random, miners have no alternative to brute-force tweaking of block contents to produce a block whose hash &mdash; and therefore, id &mdash; happens to be a lucky number. There are no heuristics to shorten the process. If you miss by a single digit, you are no closer to the prize than if you missed by 10. In the above example of 30 leading zeros, the probability of getting a lucky block in a single attempt is one in a billion, the same as tossing 30 coins and having them all land heads. It is this asymmetry between finding a lucky number (very hard) and verifying a lucky number (very easy), and the ability of each participant to independently carry out both activities without external co-ordination, which makes the decentralized lottery feasible.

    Since there are many many possible blocks which may be found as successors to the current latest block, the blockchain can potentially diverge into many branches at each step. So there is a rule that you must consider the longest valid chain as <em>the</em> blockchain, discarding all others. As long as the majority of participants follow this rule, they will all agree on a single chain.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a maintainer, you gain nothing by sulking and refusing to acknowledge a lottery winner. If a block named <strong>LEIA</strong> is acclaimed as heir to the latest block <strong>ANAKIN</strong>, then you're better off accepting her and trying to find a <strong>BEN</strong> child of <strong>LEIA</strong> child of <strong>ANAKIN</strong>. You could dispute <strong>LEIA</strong>'s succession to the Skywalker blockchain by putting up a <strong>LUKE</strong> child of <strong>ANAKIN</strong>, but unless you can quickly come up with an <strong>ANAKIN &#8594; LUKE &#8594; REY</strong> before an <strong>ANAKIN &#8594; LEIA &#8594; BEN</strong> chain is found, your efforts will be wasted. Remember, you alone will be trying to find <strong>LUKE</strong> and <strong>REY</strong> against the combined efforts of the rest of your peers who only need to find a <strong>BEN</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, if by incredible luck, you do find <strong> ANAKIN &#8594; LUKE &#8594; REY</strong> when the current consensus blockchain is <strong>ANAKIN &#8594; LEIA</strong> and no one has yet found <strong>BEN</strong>, everybody will acknowledge your chain as the legit heirs to the Skywalker dynasty. All transactions unfortunate enough to be only in block <strong>LEIA</strong> will be undone and will need to be retried. Once six generations have gone by, however, it's kinda safe to assume that transactions will not be undone. Almost impossible for a pretender to show up suddenly with six generations of impeccable lineage because of the amount of work and luck needed.
    </p>

    <p>
    If there are only a few participants, the lottery can take a distressingly long time to produce a winner, and transaction commit rate would be very low. Conversely, if we required a short zero prefix &mdash; relative to the combined CPU power of all participants &mdash; then we would get many winners in the same interval, and there would be a war of succession as the consensus on the longest chain flickers between different lines of descent.
    </p>

    <p>
    So the Bitcoin blockchain requires all miners to measure the rate of lucky number generation (i.e. the rate at which blocks are added) and dynamically adjust the zero prefix length requirement, such that there is on average one win, or block added, every 10 minutes. This interval lets news of an heir propagate through the whole network before a rival is found.
    </p>

    <p>
    What's in it for the miners? Brute-force hash computation is hard, expensive work. In Bitcoin, they're allowed to insert a special first transaction in the block which mints a fixed reward of (currently) 25 bitcoin as the lottery prize, and assign it to their own address. BitTorrent has similar incentives, like points and sharing ratios, to encourage participants to seed and contribute network bandwidth to keep torrent &lsquo;standing waves&rsquo; alive.
    </p>

    <p>
    We aren't going to discuss what gets stored in blocks and the transaction rules, because they are orthogonal to our central discussion: the mechanics of adding a block. So long as the miners agree on data format and transaction rules and validate proposed blocks against existing blockchain state, we are fine.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is what the Bitcoin blockchain looks like today:

    <p>
    Note that the zero prefix requirement has gone up from ~32 bits in 2009 to ~72 in 2016, each additional bit representing a doubling of difficulty and a corresponding increase in mining power and popularity<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Of the six impossible things Satoshi did to create Bitcoin, this is the greatest and most hilarious: to achieve distributed consensus, <em>slow down</em> the commit rate with a self-scaling lottery, so blocks are found and appended one at a time. Combined with the longest-chain rule and the tamper-proof nature of the blockchain, we get an inexorable Moving Finger, an arrow-of-time, the same simple mechanisms defending against both subversion and race conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
Distributed systems tend to be complex beasts with lots of edge cases and error recovery mechanisms. Satoshi comes along and invents a much simpler system which works under more challenging conditions. He throws out all the epicycles, synchronization mechanisms, co-ordinators, multi-phase commits, blah blah, and achieves consensus by doing exactly opposite to what the sacred values of throughput and efficiency demand, i.e. drastically reduce transactions/sec by burning up CPU.
    </p>

    <p>
Rather wisely, Satoshi has decided to remain anonymous and forego any Galactic Prize for Extreme Cleverness or he'd have been lynched by a rampaging mob of distributed systems researchers.
